# cybersecurity-anomaly-detection
A repository for detecting anomalies in cybersecurity using machine learning, focusing on phishing website identification, with scripts, models, and visualizations for enhanced cybersecurity measures.
Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection Overview This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various website features, we identify anomalies that may indicate phishing attempts.
Methodology Data Source: Collected from PhishTank, MillerSmiles, and Google's search operators. Techniques Used: Utilizes the Isolation Forest model for effective anomaly detection. Tools: Developed using scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Results The model successfully identifies characteristics of phishing websites, supported by comprehensive visualizations and statistical analyses.
Installation To set up the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/mollanegash/cybersecurity-anomaly-detection cd cybersecurity-anomaly-detection pip install -r requirements.txt
