Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection
Overview
This repository focuses on detecting anomalies in cybersecurity, specifically identifying phishing websites using machine learning. It includes scripts, models, and visualizations to enhance cybersecurity measures.

Introduction
In the realm of cybersecurity, anomaly detection plays a crucial role in identifying potential threats and malicious activities. This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using a dataset that captures various attributes indicative of phishing characteristics.

Problem Statement
The increasing sophistication of phishing attacks necessitates robust detection mechanisms. Traditional methods often struggle due to the evolving nature of phishing techniques. This study aims to utilize a feature-based approach to enhance the detection of phishing websites.

Methodology
We employed a classification approach using a dataset of phishing websites, collected from various reputable sources. The methodology involved the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
Feature Selection: Identifying key attributes relevant to phishing detection.
Model Training and Evaluation: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
Performance Metrics Assessment: Evaluating the model's effectiveness.
Data Source
PhishTank: A collaborative clearinghouse for data and information about phishing on the Internet.
MillerSmiles: A phishing and scam alert service that provides up-to-date information on phishing attempts.
Google's Search Operators: Used to gather additional data relevant to phishing detection.
Techniques Used
Isolation Forest Model: An effective anomaly detection technique used to identify phishing websites based on their features.
Tools
scikit-learn: Used for implementing machine learning models.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Used for creating visualizations to support the analysis.
Results
The analysis yielded significant insights, including:

Visualizations highlighting the distribution of key features.
Statistical analysis showing mean values, standard deviations, and ranges for features such as URL length, presence of an IP address, and use of URL shortening services.
For instance, the PageRank and Google Index features exhibited mean values of 0.483079 and 0.528978, respectively, with maximum values indicating potentially high-risk URLs.
Visualizations

Conclusion
The findings underscore the importance of feature selection in detecting phishing websites. By leveraging machine learning techniques and robust datasets, organizations can enhance their defenses against phishing threats.
